Alongside economic reforms, governments brought in policies that slashed infant mortality, reduced population growth and extended life expectancy, all within a few decades. That the policies worked is clear, but how they came about is less so. “It has never been obvious why an elite known best for corruption and violent winner-takes-all politics should have committed to a progressive, inclusive development pathway,” writes Ms Hossain.

The country chose Tagore’s song “Amar Shonar Bangla” (“My Golden Bengal”), which he wrote to protest against the partition of Bengal by the British in 1905, to be its anthem. Tagore, who received the Nobel prize for literature in 1913, was from a landowning Hindu family. Born in Kolkata, today in the Indian state of West Bengal, he spent several years during the 1890s in his ancestral home in Shelaidaha, Kushtia, in East Bengal (Bangladesh today). There he chronicled the lives of—mostly Muslim—peasants. Tagore’s short stories are vignettes of everyday life in Bengal during the rise of India’s independence movement. They both typify and celebrate the Bengali language and a Bengali identity that transcends religious divides. This is why the government of Pakistan, founded to be a Muslim country, tried to ban some of Tagore’s works. As Bangladesh has become more Islamicised in recent decades, Tagore’s short stories have lost favour. Religious and secular Bangladeshis now have different attitudes towards writings that once inspired unity. Beautifully translated by William Radice, Tagore’s short stories help make sense of Bangladesh’s past and show why it matters so much today.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"type":"tag","name":"b","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The World in My Hands.

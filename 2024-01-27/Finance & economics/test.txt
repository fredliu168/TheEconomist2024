The geopolitical distance America’s trade must cover is only a little above the global average. It is far shorter than the diplomatic distances bridged by China.

Since 2017, America has managed to shorten the geopolitical distance covered by its trade by 10%, on McKinsey’s scale.

Much of the trade countries carry out with ideological rivals is trade of necessity: alternative suppliers are not easy to find. McKinsey looks at what it calls “concentrated” products, where three or fewer countries account for the lion’s share of global exports. This kind of product accounts for a disproportionate share of the trade that spans long geopolitical distances. Australia, for example, dominates exports of iron ore to China. Likewise China dominates exports of batteries made from neodymium, a “rare-earth” metal.

Friendshoring will give countries a narrower range of trading partners, obliging them to put their eggs in fewer baskets.

There are simply not enough big economies in its geopolitical orbit to compensate for reduced trade with unfriendly Western trading partners.

It is conceivable that non-aligned countries might move closer to China politically, as China embraces them economically. Certainly, by spurning Chinese trade and investment, the West would give China added incentive to ingratiate itself with the rest of the world.

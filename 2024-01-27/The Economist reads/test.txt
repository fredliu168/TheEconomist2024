The United States, which backed the government, initially denied that a massacre had taken place.

Vega denounces everything from the the “filthy beer, for animals, that only produces diarrhoea” to Salvadoreans themselves, whom he deems ignorant and repulsive. Readers assumed that the book, published in 1997, expressed Mr Castellanos Moya’s own views. In response to death threats he left the country.

Like El Salvador’s, it pitted left-wing guerrillas against an American-backed government, which had little interest in distinguishing between fighters and civilians. The war had ended two years before Gerardi’s killing, but his quest for truth and accountability threatened elites intent on keeping power. In this book Francisco Goldman, an American writer of Guatemalan descent, investigates the murder in detail and names the people he believes were responsible, including military men. Most were later brought to trial and sentenced. Although Mr Goldman’s focus is the murder of the bishop, his reporting reveals much about the abuses inflicted on Guatemalans and about how the mafias of power work in the country.

But it is widely thought that Miguel Asturias, a diplomat as well as an author, had in mind his home country of Guatemala. “The President”, available in a fine new English translation, explores the effects of dictatorships on a country and society. Asturias uses surrealism to convey the psychological impact of living under repressive rule, and satire to mock the rulers themselves, which is one of the things that make the book enjoyable to read. Considered a classic, it is still relevant today, when many democracies in Central America remain fragile.

Like El Salvador’s, it pitted left-wing guerrillas against an American-backed government, which had little interest in distinguishing between fighters and civilians. The war had ended two years before Gerardi’s killing, but his quest for truth and accountability threatened elites intent on keeping power.

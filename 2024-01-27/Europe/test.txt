An expert blackmailer, he blocked the €50bn deal at a summit in December, forcing his fellow leaders back to Brussels. He may do so again, though he now has a new source of blackmail: after Turkey’s parliament signed off on Sweden’s accession to \u003csmall\u003eNATO\u003c/small\u003e on January 23rd, Hungary is the only hold-out."},{"type":"CROSSHEAD","text":"Show me the money"},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"Amid the haggling and the summiteering, some simple facts seem to have been overlooked.

Asked why he joined the Russians, Mr Otara cites the “schism” in Ukraine.

He believes the Russian church waded into Africa to spread propaganda and stoke hostility towards the West. The idea is less risible than it may at first seem. The Russian church’s favourite subject—“traditional values” and how the decadent West wants to pervert them—aligns with conservative religious views in Africa, where clerics tend to oppose homosexuality.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Yet the Russian foray seems half-hearted and poorly financed.

The Russians might pay more, but many priests are still too busy making ends meet to rail against the West. “I normally do some side-hustling,” explains one of the church’s priests in western Kenya, who runs a shop in his spare time. “It’s for survival, and for my children.”","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Many of the Russian church’s problems can be blamed on erratic leadership.

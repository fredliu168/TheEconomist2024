AFTER THREE years of ruthless hardline government under Ebrahim Raisi, Iran’s 61m voters  for president. Ahead of Iran’s snap presidential election, scheduled for June 28th, the Islamic Republic’s electoral-vetting body approved six candidates: three hardliners, two pragmatic conservatives and a reformer. Given that the first five are likely to split the traditionalist vote, a good turnout might even propel a reformist back into the presidency. The helicopter crash that  on May 19th “could re-energise Iranian politics”, says a political observer in the capital, Tehran.
The front-runner is a pragmatic conservative, Mohammad Baqer Qalibaf. As a former military commander and police chief, speaker of parliament and an ally of the supreme leader, Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, he has the credentials of a regime stalwart. If the other four conservatives drop out of the race and lend him their backing (as often happens in Iranian elections), he should be a shoo-in. That said, as a previous three-time presidential contender, he also has a record as a loser. Critics berate him over corruption allegations—which he denies—and hypocrisy (though Mr Qalibaf condemns the West, his son applied for Canadian citizenship).

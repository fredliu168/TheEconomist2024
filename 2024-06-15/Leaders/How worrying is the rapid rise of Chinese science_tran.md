IF THERE IS one thing the Chinese Communist Party and America’s security hawks agree on, it is that  to geopolitical, economic and military superiority. President Xi Jinping hopes that science and technology will help his country overtake America. Using a mix of  and sanctions, politicians in Washington are trying to prevent China from gaining a technological advantage.
America’s strategy is unlikely to work. As we report this week, Chinese science and innovation are making rapid progress. It is also misguided. If America wants to maintain its lead—and to get the most benefit from the research of China’s talented scientists—it would do better to focus less on keeping Chinese science down and more on pushing itself ahead.

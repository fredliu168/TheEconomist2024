What is love? A many-splendoured thing; the power that makes the world go round; a madness; a fire that can warm your heart or burn down the house; a deep sea; the greatest pleasure; infinity; blindness. The course of love never did run smooth. In the words of an Alaskan Native whom Helen Fisher liked to quote, it was also a pain as terrible “as a boil about to burst”.

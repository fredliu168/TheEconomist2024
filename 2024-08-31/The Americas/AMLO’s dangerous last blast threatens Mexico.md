Most Mexican presidents would be a lame duck in their last month in power. But not Andrés Manuel López Obrador. After newly elected congressmen and women take their seats on September 1st, a month before president-elect Claudia Sheinbaum takes office, Mr López Obrador will take advantage. His ruling party Morena and its allies will be so dominant he will almost certainly be able to pass a constitutional reform of the judiciary.

THE Placards at Donald Trump’s rallies put it bluntly: “Mass deportations now!” If elected again, Mr Trump promises the largest expulsion of illegal immigrants in American history. He has praised Operation Wetback, a big deportation programme under President Dwight Eisenhower. Pressed for details, J.D. Vance, Mr Trump’s running-mate, suggested that their administration would start by deporting 1m people and then take it from there. Could they actually do it?

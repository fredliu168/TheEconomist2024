##### It is a Rorschach nation

A CENTURY AGO a Swiss psychoanalyst called Hermann Rorschach pioneered a diagnostic test that would eventually become famous worldwide. Patients were shown a series of inkblot patterns on cards, and asked to describe what they saw. The result was thought to reveal much about their state of mind.
For fans of foreign affairs and students of public policy, here is another kind of Rorschach test: ask them about Singapore, and see what they say. The tiny nation’s undoubted success is analysed endlessly. But the lessons drawn from it tend to reveal more about the viewer than they do about the city-state.
Observers from wildly different countries all agree that there is much to like in a country notable for its sparkling infrastructure, low crime, high social cohesion and sky-high gdp of $88,000 per person. Liz Truss, a former (and disastrous) British prime minister, has argued that her country should have become “Singapore on steroids” after leaving the European Union; by that she had in mind an economic model of very low taxes and ultra-light regulation. The respective presidents of Rwanda and El Salvador, Paul Kagame and Nayib Bukele—the one a stern authoritarian and the other a Trump-style populist disdainful of democratic checks on power—handily see proof in illiberal Singapore that Western-style democracy is not required to reach first-world prosperity.

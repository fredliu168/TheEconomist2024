The mini-markets in Amman, Jordan’s capital, have banished Coca-Cola, a brand long associated with America, Israel’s closest ally. Local franchises of other American firms have printed leaflets stressing their support for the Palestinian cause, especially in Gaza. But such virtue-signalling hardly helps King Abdullah, who is awkwardly caught between growing popular support for Hamas and the peace treaty with Israel signed by his father, King Hussein, back in 1994.
Islamists have long been entrenched in Jordan under the aegis of the Muslim Brotherhood, of which Hamas is a branch. Opinion polls conducted a month after Hamas’s attack on October 7th (and Israel’s retaliation) suggested that 66% of Jordanians approved of the group’s actions.

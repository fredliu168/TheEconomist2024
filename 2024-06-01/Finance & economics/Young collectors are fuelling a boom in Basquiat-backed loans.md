Buying art can be a nerve-racking experience. But investors have long been able to console themselves with the thought that, if their purchase plummets in value, they will at least have something nice on their wall. Now they can also console themselves that they will have something to borrow against. 
That is because there has been a boom in “art-secured lending”. Until recently this was only available to the wealthiest clients of private banks. In the past five years, though, auction houses and boutique lenders have become more involved. Deloitte, a consultancy, reckons that such outfits increased their lending by 119% over the period, compared with a 31% rise at banks. Last year non-banks doled out as much as $8bn against art and collectibles, or 23% of all such loans, up from 15% in 2019.

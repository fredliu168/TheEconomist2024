I take a more positive view. The purpose of export controls is to raise costs to competitors by impeding access to better technologies. Those who impose and implement such controls are well aware that countries subject to them try to circumvent them through smuggling, buying substitutes from alternative suppliers, or developing replacement products. These activities are costly. Smuggling is a poor substitute for having an established arrangement with a supplier.

China has many capable people, but when confined to collaborating solely with Chinese colleagues, they do not fully share in the developments taking place elsewhere.

China has many capable people, but when confined to collaborating solely with Chinese colleagues, they do not fully share in the developments taking place elsewhere. Moreover, China had pursued policies to develop its own technologies in these areas long before the embargoes. Being cut off from collaboration with Western companies is unlikely to make its efforts more successful.","textHtml":"During the cold war, export controls caused the Soviet Union to invest heavily in inferior electronics, diverting resources that could have gone to other uses.

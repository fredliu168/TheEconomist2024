Eventually, after he was allowed to write, Catholic priests and other visitors smuggled his papers out of the penal colony. The quartet’s protagonist is Minke, a journalist and revolutionary who comes of age as Indonesian nationalism begins to spread. An everyman of sorts, Minke befriends characters who exemplify the kaleidoscope of Indonesia, from the formidable concubine of a crazed Dutch man to a working-class soldier turned servant. The Buru Quartet was published after Pramoedya’s release in 1979 but Suharto’s government banned its sale. Even though the ban was lifted in 2010, high schools do not include Pramoedya’s works in their curriculums. That omission shows how nervous the government remains about his Marxist ideology.

The offensive against the Indonesian communists succeeded.

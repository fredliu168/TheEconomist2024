America’s annual  rate slowed to 3.1% in January. Although that was down from the 3.4% recorded in December, the dip was smaller than had been expected. Stockmarkets shuddered, as investors reduced their bets for an early interest-rate cut by the Federal Reserve. The Dow Jones Industrial Average had its worst day in almost a year.

Ramon Laguarta, the chief executive, said that was in part due to pricing. Carrefour, a big supermarket chain in France, has stopped stocking Pepsi’s goods because of its “unacceptable price increases”.

Cost of living concerns are not stopping people from travelling. , Europe’s biggest tour operator, reported a big surge in quarterly revenue, and confirmed it expects sales to rise by 10% this year.

Arjuna Capital and Follow This, two activist-shareholder groups, asked a court to throw out  against them for the proxy motion they had proposed that called on the company to slash emissions. Arjuna and Follow This withdrew their motion when Exxon lodged the suit, but Exxon is still pursuing it, because it wants “clarity on a process that has become ripe for abuse”.

The suit alleges breach of contract by making subscribers pay an extra $2.99 a month for the ad-free service they had signed up to.

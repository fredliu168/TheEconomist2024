LABOUR’S strong results in local elections in Britain on May 2nd affirm the prediction from our  that it is on course to form the next government—our central estimate gives it a thumping 106-seat majority. The transformation of Labour’s political fortunes since the last general election has been accompanied by a fervent romancing of business. Gone is the disdain of Jeremy Corbyn, the party’s former hard-left leader, who planned to collectivise a tenth of every big British company. In its place Sir Keir Starmer and Rachel Reeves, the Labour leader and shadow chancellor, have spearheaded a “smoked-salmon offensive”, inviting executives to breakfast and waxing lyrical about the virtues of profit. 
Bosses are keen to listen. It is easier to get tickets to see Taylor Swift’s opening night at Wembley next month than to attend the party’s “business day” in September at a dingy Liverpool conference centre. Executives can see which way the electoral wind is blowing, obviously, but there is more to it than that. Polls of business leaders suggest they would rather see Labour in power than the Conservatives.

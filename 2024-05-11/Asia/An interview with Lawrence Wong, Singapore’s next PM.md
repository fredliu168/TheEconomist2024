Singapore is coming under new management. Lawrence Wong, the finance minister and deputy prime minister, will take the reins of the city-state’s government on May 15th. The country does not churn through prime ministers: he will be just the fourth in its history as an independent country since 1965. Mr Wong sat down with  on May 6th.
Aged 51, Mr Wong was born seven years into Singapore’s existence as a nation. He is also more of an everyman than his predecessors. He is the first not to have attended an elite secondary school, and grew up on a public-housing estate.

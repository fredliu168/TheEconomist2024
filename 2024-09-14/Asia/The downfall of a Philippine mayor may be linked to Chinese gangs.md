The small town of Bamban in the Philippines is fairly unremarkable. But it has become the place of feverish headlines this year ever since allegations emerged that Alice Guo, who was elected mayor of the town in 2022, abused her position to protect online casinos operating from there. Government officials have stated that these gambling hubs were a front for financial fraud, money-laundering, human trafficking, kidnapping, torture and murder. In July the 34-year-old Ms Guo went missing. On September 3rd she was arrested in Indonesia. Ms Guo denies having any links to criminal activity.

Some governments have precious places—towns and villages that express their vision of Britain, that are filled with the sort of people who voted for them. For Boris Johnson’s governments, the place was Teesside, a Brexity part of north-east England.

But few were fooled: Lord Cameron will always be associated with the rich, untroubled town of Chipping Norton in the Cotswolds.

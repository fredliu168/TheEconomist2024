FIRST, pick an approachable avatar. In “The Perfect Couple”, a glitzy new drama on Netflix, this role is played by Amelia (Eve Hewson), a zookeeper engaged to marry into the filthy-rich Winbury clan. In  it is Greg, doofus cousin of the plutocratic Roy family. In “The Great Gatsby” it is Nick, who tells how the opulent Buchanans “smashed up things and creatures and then retreated back into their money”.

When Netflix released the first season of “Emily in Paris” in 2020, French critics ridiculed the American-made drama for its Instagrammable clichés and vacuous plot. The series was “a fantasised vision disconnected from reality”, sniffed , a newspaper. “No cliché is spared,” wrote , a film magazine, including that “the French are all mean and all lazy” and “incorrigible flirts”. A critic for , Parisians’ highbrow bible, finished viewing the first season feeling queasy, “as if I had eaten all the macaroons in the box by myself”.

###### Radiation-belt remediation
# Particles that damage satellites can be flushed out of orbit 
##### All it takes is very long radio waves

ELECTRONIC SYSTEMS do not respond well to highly charged particles. Accelerated to near the speed of light by Earthâ€™s magnetic field, such particles pack enough kinetic energy to cause damage. History offers ample evidence of the consequences: in 1859 a massive solar storm known as the Carrington event started fires at telegraph stations. A century later, a big American nuclear test called Starfish Prime released enough energetic particles to fry a third of all satellites then in orbit.

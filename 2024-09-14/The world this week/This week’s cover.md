Our global cover this week looks at the mess that could follow America’s vote. After election night, complexity will meet conspiracy. America is the only proper presidential democracy in which the person who wins the most votes does not necessarily win power. The two-month gap between voting and election certification in Congress is the most drawn-out anywhere. Mr Trump is drumming up his false claim that the election in 2020 was stolen. The stakes for him are high, and if the race ends up being tight, the outcome could be baleful.

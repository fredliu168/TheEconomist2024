For five weeks a harrowing rape trial taking place in a courtroom in the southern town of Avignon has shaken France. Dominique Pelicot, a retired 71-year-old, stands accused of drugging his then wife, Gis√®le, raping her, inviting dozens of other men recruited online to rape her too while she was unconscious, and of filming them, all over a period of nine years. The trial, due to run until December, has opened French eyes to the horror of chemical submission and to what appears to be a disturbing misunderstanding of what constitutes rape, as well as to the remarkable courage and dignity of a woman who decided to make her ordeal public. French law on rape may now be changed as a result.

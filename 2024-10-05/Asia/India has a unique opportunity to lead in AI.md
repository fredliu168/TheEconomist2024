HINDI IS THE world’s most widely spoken language after English and Mandarin. Yet it constitutes only 0.1% of all freely accessible content on the internet. That is one obstacle to India developing its own generative artificial-intelligence (AI) models, which rely on vast amounts of training data. Another is that Hindi is spoken by less than half the country. More than 60 other languages have at least 100,000 speakers. Data for some of them simply do not exist online, says Manish Gupta, who leads DeepMind, Google’s AI arm, in India. Natives of those languages stand to miss out on the AI revolution.

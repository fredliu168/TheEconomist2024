This was his account of Churchill’s passionate address to his “outer” cabinet in a packed room at the House of Commons.

Benn, a standard bearer for the far left, had a grandstand seat for those exchanges, first as secretary of state for industry, then for energy. These were the years of trade-union power and the three-day week, when Britain was branded “the sick man of Europe”. Usually around midnight Benn would sit down in his study and recount his day’s struggles into his cassette recorder, leaving others to transcribe the tapes. The narrative rarely slackens and the detail of meetings and conversations is quite remarkable. Benn would always tell journalists, a little pompously, that his interest lay in political argument, not in personalities. Yet there are plenty of colourful vignettes of both colleagues and rivals.

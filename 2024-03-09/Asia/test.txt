Among the middle class, sedentary lifestyles mean that energy expenditure is low and carbohydrates turn into deposits of fat. Overconsumption of grain aﬀects the poor too, for whom meat, fruit and fresh vegetables are luxuries. Around 10% of the poorest quintile are overweight, compared with around 39% of the richest.

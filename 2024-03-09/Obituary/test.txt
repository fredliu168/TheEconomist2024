Instead, the museum people were so astonished when they went through her collection, rooting through all the boxes, all the armoires and even under her bed, that they asked her to dress 85 mannequins, and the show, called Rara Avis (Rare Bird) was a sensation.

You couldn’t learn that, or buy it. But you could recognise it right away, even in tiny things, like the three-tiepin arrangement she praised once on an Englishman’s lapel. With her eye for quality as well as pizazz, from the 1950s she had built up a select reputation as an interior designer. She and Carl had started a company, Old World Weavers, to find and replicate rare fabrics from every corner of the globe. These had ended up in the apartments of Estée Lauder and Greta Garbo, as well as in the White House, from Truman onwards. By the 1970s she was using her mother’s apartment on Park Avenue, with its harpsichords and Venetian screens, and would escort guests to New York City’s fanciest clubs and restaurants.

She also devised a coffee table once out of columns and glass from a demolished building in the Bowery. Economy and improvisation were the words she lived by. As a small child, bored on visits to her grandparents, she was allowed to sort through big pillowcases of fabric remnants, putting the scraps together as she pleased. It was great training. Like all the family (her grandfather was a master-tailor, her mother devoted to accessories, and money short during the Depression and the war) she learned early to sew, glue and paint to make something out of next to nothing. Improvisation was like jazz, she thought.

Loehmann’s in Brooklyn, with gorgeous clothes at rock-bottom prices, was her Holy Grail. A plastic bracelet for four dollars and some change pleased her as much as if Carl had suggested a trip to Harry Winston, the luxury jeweller. (She also replicated her own pieces for the Home Shopping Network, giving less well-off women the chance to buy them.) Flea markets and souks were a joy.

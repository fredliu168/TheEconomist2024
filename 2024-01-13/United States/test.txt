Mr DeSantis has improved as a candidate, but not as much as, say, Barack Obama had by this point. Having tried for too long to duck combat with Mr Trump, Mr DeSantis has honed his own criticisms.

But he has delighted in playing the Road Runner to Mr DeSantis’s flummoxed Coyote, Bugs Bunny to his plodding Elmer Fudd. “There’s another version of Ron DeSantis where he really celebrates the American dream,” says Stuart Stevens, a Republican consultant who advised Mr Romney and Mr Bush, among others. “He’s a middle-class guy from Florida, went to Harvard, Yale: ‘I represent what is possible in America, and I want to make it possible for everyone.’ You would have liked that guy.” ","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Mr Trump is now training his fire on a more adept politician, Nikki Haley.

Two-fifths of undergraduates surveyed last year by Chegg reported using an \u003csmall\u003eAI\u003c/small\u003e chatbot to help them with their studies, with half of those using it daily. Indeed, the technology’s popularity has raised awkward questions for companies like Chegg, whose share price plunged last May after Dan Rosensweig, its chief executive, told investors it was losing customers to Chat\u003csmall\u003eGPT\u003c/small\u003e. Yet there are good reasons to believe that education specialists who harness \u003csmall\u003eAI \u003c/small\u003ewill eventually prevail over generalists such as Open\u003csmall\u003eAI\u003c/small\u003e, the maker of Chat\u003csmall\u003eGPT\u003c/small\u003e, and other tech firms eyeing the education business."},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"For one, AI chatbots have a bad habit of spouting nonsense, an unhelpful trait in an educational context. “Students want content from trusted providers,” argues Kate Edwards, chief pedagogist at Pearson, a textbook publisher.

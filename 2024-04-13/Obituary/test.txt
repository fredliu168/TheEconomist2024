At home, Rose was expected to dress for dinner, curtsy to guests and hunt both deer and a husband. And above all she had to do “the season”, that “upper-class version of a puberty rite” as the writer Jessica Mitford called it, when four hundred girls in pearls curtsied before the queen.

It was the wrong question: she was not a rebel despite her advantages but because of them. Oxford had liberated her from her sex and class.

Years of crawling on her belly stalking deer made her the perfect guerrilla fighter. Hadn’t Mao said that political power grew from the barrel of a gun? Well, Rose knew how to wield one.

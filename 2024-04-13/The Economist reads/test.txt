But the moments of utter satisfaction, when result matches intention, are vividly recorded, too. Who but Updike would weave Herodotus, Artemis, Florence Nightingale, George Eliot, Dante and his own fictional creation Rabbit Angstrom into a book about golf?

It tells the story of the US Open at Brookline Country Club in 1913, an epic battle between Harry Vardon, a 43-year-old Briton who by then had won six majors, and 20-year-old Bostonian Francis Ouimet, an amateur who lived across the street from the course.

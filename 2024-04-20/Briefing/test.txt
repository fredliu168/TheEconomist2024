That of Texas has more than tripled over the same period. In general Americans have long flocked to “Sunbelt” states in the South and south-west.

For example, when there is far more housing available than people to fill it, the result tends to be a collapse in the value of homes. If it is severe enough, landlords and even homeowners stop maintaining their properties, because the cost of repairs is higher than the return they will generate.

The population of Paducah, Kentucky, 30 miles away on the other side of the Ohio river from Cairo, grew by 8.4% in the 2010s. Many who have stayed put still leave Illinois to buy petrol and groceries, to benefit from lower sales taxes elsewhere. As revenue gradually diminishes in this way in much of Illinois, the state is becoming ever more dependent on the taxpayers of its one metropolis, Chicago.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The biggest contributor to death spirals is often pensions for government workers. As America’s population ages, the overall burden of paying for such pensions is getting heavier everywhere. But many pensions are funded locally—and there are often shortfalls.

As a result, says Mr Berry, “Places that shrink are screwed.”","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"When Detroit went bankrupt in 2013, the state of Michigan bailed out its pensioners. But such bail-outs are dependent on the state having reasonably healthy finances. When the population of a state as a whole is stagnant or shrinking, that becomes much less likely. Across Illinois the total burden of unfunded state and local pension liabilities is estimated to be around $210bn, or roughly four times the state’s entire annual budget. Despite recent reforms, the state government does not expect state pensions to be fully funded for another 25 years. Chicago, meanwhile, is grappling with its own pension problems.

People are better off if they can move to opportunity, instead of becoming trapped in dying cities or jobless rural areas. Indeed, competition between cities helps explain America’s economic dynamism; many economists would like there to be even more movement. Although people are flocking to new jobs in places like Houston or Atlanta, high housing costs stop workers from moving to even better paid jobs in places like San Francisco or New York City. If those cities built more housing, they would attract more workers from other parts of America. Places like Cairo would shrink even faster, but America as a whole would be richer.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"Yet in reality, shrinking is hugely politically unpopular because, inevitably, many people are left behind, and the lives of those unwilling or unable to move worsen as their neighbours depart.

All manner of big government facilities, from air-force bases to prisons, can be located in rural areas, ensuring there are jobs that in turn sustain the rest of the economy.

The cash is in essence a marketing device to get potential movers to consider a town they might not otherwise have heard of, says Dan Ridenour, the city’s Republican mayor. “It’s become very competitive—and not just for remote workers, for all workers,” he says.

The result is a much larger pool of potentially mobile workers over whom cities can compete—hence the growth of the business. Yet a taxpayer gained by Muncie, Indiana, is one lost to somewhere else. And with growth overall slowing, not everywhere can win.

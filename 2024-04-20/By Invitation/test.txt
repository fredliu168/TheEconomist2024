As a result, there was no access to daily medications for people with chronic illnesses, such as diabetes, and those with cardiological, renal, oncological and haematological diseases. Of the 12 renal dialysis machines that were available in our hospital, ten had broken down and the other two could not cope with the 30-fold increase in patients requiring dialysis.

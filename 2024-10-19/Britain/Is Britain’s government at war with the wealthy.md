Wealthy people have distinctive hobbies. One of them is talking, often noisily, about moving abroad to escape high taxes. In the run-up to the Labour government’s first budget, due on October 30th, rich Britons have some cause for concern.

Sir Keir Starmer, the prime minister, has said that “the broadest shoulders should bear the heavier burden”.

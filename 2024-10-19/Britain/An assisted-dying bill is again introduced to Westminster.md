ON October 16th, on a grey morning in Westminster, a gaggle of pink-clad campaigners with placards gathered in Parliament Square. “Kim Leadbeater MP: Thank you for giving us hope,” read one sign. Later that day, Ms Leadbeater, a Labour MP, introduced a bill in the House of Commons to allow  for the terminally ill in England and Wales.

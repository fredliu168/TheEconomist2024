“That’s not a woman’s position,” a straw-hatted Amish man in Lancaster County, Pennsylvania, says wistfully, referring to the presidency. “I’ve got [voter-registration] papers in my pocket right now.” He’s been taking part in a “mud sale”, an Amish charity auction, in a field near the community of Paradise. While the auctioneer shows off his impressive lung capacity, several Republican volunteers mingle among the crowd handing out voter-registration papers and Trump-Vance flags. “I did this four years ago,” one of them says, and “it’s even better now.”

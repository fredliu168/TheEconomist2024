Reform uk may have an address at 83 Victoria Street in London. The right-wing challenger party may be registered with the Electoral Commission, a bit below Putting Crewe First and a few spots above Revolutionary Communist Party Britain (Marxist-Leninist). Courtesy of Nigel Farage, its honorary president, the party may attract reams of media coverage. It may well be, according to the polls, the third-largest party in Britain. 
But it does not exist. The trappings of a political party are there; the content is not. From its voters to its candidates to its leader to its sole mp, nothing is real about .

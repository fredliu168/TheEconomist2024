Any degree of Chinese control over the production of chips is intolerable to America. The other is green technology, as its components may become the backbone of the entire global economy. For China the strength of its companies in this arena is not just a natural consequence of two decades of focused industrial policy, but a confirmation of its important role as a global leader.","__typename":"ParagraphComponent"},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"At the moment the battle is over apps.

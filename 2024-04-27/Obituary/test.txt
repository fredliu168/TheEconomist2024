He had done so much else. Before it, he had been a Marine, joining straight out of high school and seeing combat duty in Vietnam. Then, after studying journalism at Iowa State, he had signed on with the Associated Press. He reported from Japan and South Africa, and then volunteered—volunteered!—for the Beirut desk. There was a civil war in Lebanon, but he found that fascinating, the best job he ever had. There were straightforward good times, too, when he and his colleagues and Madeleine, his beautiful Lebanese fiancée, would gather on the balcony of his seaside apartment, high above the rubbled streets, smoke cigars, sip Scotch and watch the twilight come down over the sea.

He taught journalism at several universities, and set up a foundation to build schools in Vietnam. He became honorary chairman of the Committee to Protect Journalists, and helped homeless veterans. Other ventures didn’t go so well. He had to close two restaurants and a bar, the Blue Gator in Athens, Ohio, where he hoped to indulge his love of blues. His charter-boat business went bust, and his horse farm had to be sold. He ran for the Ohio Senate, but lost. In 2009 he declared bankruptcy. There were three marriages and three divorces. His weight ballooned. He had to admit he was sometimes a jerk. But had he always been one, or had those seven years made him one? If so, they had also made him a hero and a famous man. He tried not to think about them, but they would not go away.

(Jogging, no smoking, a low-carb diet.) His play absorbed him rather more than the green Mercedes sedan that kept cruising past the court. But as he drove home the car drew up alongside; three gunmen ran from it, pulled his door open and thrust him inside. He was to be a prisoner of these Hizbullah militants for almost seven years. Because he plied his reporter’s trade openly, they took him for a spy. ","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"His own arrogance got him kidnapped, he said. He thought he was safe. His subsequent treatment both infuriated him and reduced him at times to despair. He did not think they would kill him; it was clear they wanted to trade him for their own captured comrades. Nor did they torture him, as they did others. But they were young, pistol-happy and with an enemy in their hands, so they did their brutal best to degrade him. He was kept chained and often blindfolded, with no idea where he was. As the war ebbed and flowed he was moved around Lebanon, strapped to the chassis of a truck or, at times, in a coffin, taped up like a corpse.

Most of the food was inedible. For perhaps a year and a half in total he was kept in solitary confinement, which he could barely endure. As a Christian he tried for hours to pray, but found just a blankness in which he was talking to himself, not God. It was all too easy to believe that the world had forgotten him. (His sister, Peggy Say, was lobbying everyone she could think of to gain his release, and the Reagan administration was embarking on an illegal scheme of selling arms to Iran, Hizbullah’s sponsor, but he knew none of that.)

His fellow prisoners—principally Brian Keenan, John McCarthy and Tom Sutherland—helped him greatly.

They played poker with a deck he made out of scrap paper, and chess with pieces he crafted from the silver foil round processed cheese.

But he, like his fellow captives, was damaged more than he knew. He found it hard to deal with relationships, decision-making, emotions and crowds. He married Madeleine quickly, but then divorced her. Counselling helped only so far.

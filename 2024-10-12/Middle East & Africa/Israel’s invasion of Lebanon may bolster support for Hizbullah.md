THE BRIGHT yellow flags of Hizbullah that line the highway leading south out of Saida, a port city in southern Lebanon, seem like the standards of a floundering kingdom.

The decapitation, almost overnight, of the Hizbullah’s military leadership, and the assassination of its charismatic leader, , have shocked everyone, not least the Shia group’s own supporters.

House-hunting is a favourite British pastime. The country’s three most popular property portals—which aggregate listings from 25,000 estate agencies—attract around 10m people each month. Actually buying and selling homes is a lot less fun. Conveyancing is still almost entirely paper-based; solicitors regard email as cutting-edge technology; many social landlords lack good digital records; and so on. That creates an opportunity for property-tech (“prop-tech”) entrepreneurs to improve the efficiency of the market.

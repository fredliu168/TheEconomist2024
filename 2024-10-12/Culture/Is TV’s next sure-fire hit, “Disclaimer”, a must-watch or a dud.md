Read the early reviews of “Disclaimer” and you may be confused. Write-ups of the seven-part thriller, which debuts on Apple TV+ on October 11th, lurch between two stars and five. Is the lavish series, directed by Alfonso Cuarón and starring Cate Blanchett (pictured), a must-watch or dud? Whom should you trust, the boosters or carpers? The answer is both. The show is an example of what might be called good-bad art, and a lesson in evaluating it.

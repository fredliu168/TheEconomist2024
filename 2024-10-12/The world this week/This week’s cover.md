THE CHOICE facing America in less than a month will not be made by voters weighing rival sets of policies. Kamala Harris’s plans lack detail; Donald Trump’s are sometimes untethered from reality—and in any case divisions over culture motivate voters more than tax policy. Yet the choice matters hugely in policy terms, for America and the rest of the world. This aspect of the election has been under-covered relative to fantasies about what Haitian migrants in Ohio have for lunch. In our worldwide cover this week, we look at the areas where we think the election will make the most difference. In a series of eight policy briefs, we find that whoever gets to 270 electoral-college votes on November 5th, Mr Trump’s ideas will win. He, not Ms Harris, has set the terms of this contest. From immigration to trade and energy, American policy has become thoroughly Trumpified.

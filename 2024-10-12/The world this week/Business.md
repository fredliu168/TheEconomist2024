America’s Department of Justice laid out its proposals for how to deal with , after a court in August found that the company had acted illegally to maintain a monopoly in internet search. In a filing to the court the government said the options it is considering include “behavioural and structural remedies” that would stop Google from using products such as Chrome, Play and Android to give it an advantage in search over rivals—in effect, a break-up of Google. Another option is forcing Google to share users’ search data with rivals. Google said the proposals were a threat to American competitiveness. The judge in the case won’t issue his recommendation until August.

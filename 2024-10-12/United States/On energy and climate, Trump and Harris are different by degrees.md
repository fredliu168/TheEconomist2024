###### Policy brief
# On energy and climate, Trump and Harris are different by degrees 
##### Green subsidies will probably survive Mr Trump’s re-election, and Big Oil will probably do just fine under Ms Harris

The next president will inherit the most ambitious climate policies in American history. Under Joe Biden a trio of laws—the CHIPS and Science Act, the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law and especially the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA)—have put in place a sweeping industrial policy that seeks to subsidise an ambitious decarbonisation of the economy. Left-wingers, who think the investments are not ambitious enough, hope that a President Kamala Harris will go further. Conservatives are confident a re-elected President Donald Trump will tear it all down.

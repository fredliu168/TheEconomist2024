NOT ONLY are taxes one of the only certainties in life, they are also one of the only certainties in this presidential election. That is because of the looming expiration of tax provisions passed in 2017, the main legislative accomplishment of Donald Trumpâ€™s term in the White House. This presents a fiscal cliff. By the end of 2025 whoever is president must sign new rules into law, or most Americans will see sharply higher income taxes.

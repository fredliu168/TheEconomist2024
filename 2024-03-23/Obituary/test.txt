He determined to give the scientific sceptics the evidence they demanded—hundreds of experiments, hours of video and reams of data—to prove that every emotion humans felt, other primates felt too. When he looked into the eyes of a chimpanzee, an intelligent and self-assured personality looked back. Darwin had felt the same when he saw tickled chimps laugh, just as his children did. His most blinkered opponents were the 20th-century behaviourists, who reduced animals to machines and their laughter to “vocalised panting”.

(As a bit of a hippy himself, virtually as hairy in the 1970s as a bonobo, he warmed to that.)

But then one was rewarded with a grape. The slighted monkey noticed, and got uneasy.

He saw males providing child care when females were absent, even slowing their pace through the forest to let the little one keep up. Same-sex sex was common, and anything went; there was no intolerance.

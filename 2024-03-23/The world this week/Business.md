The change in direction had been signalled for months, but Ueda Kazuo, the bank’s governor, said it would maintain “accommodative financial conditions”. The bank will still buy about ¥6trn ($40bn) a month in government bonds.

HP subsequently took a huge write-down on the value of its acquisition and alleged that Mr Lynch, Autonomy’s founder, had deceived the company.

The Biden administration unveiled sweeping new  which it hopes will ensure that most new cars and light trucks sold in America are either pure-electric or hybrid by 2032.

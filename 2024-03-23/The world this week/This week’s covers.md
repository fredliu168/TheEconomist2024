##### How we saw the world

Some weeks, including this one, we publish more than one cover. In most of the world, we consider Israel’s predicament as the war in Gaza continues. Talks over a temporary ceasefire with Hamas may fail. That could leave Israel locked in the bleakest trajectory of its 75-year existence, featuring endless occupation, hard-right politics and isolation. We argue that America should help it find a better strategy.

In Britain, we explain why the country is the best place in Europe to be an immigrant. The idea of Britain as a nation of immigration might seem counterintuitive. Its citizens voted to leave the European Union in 2016 after they were promised a tighter chokehold on inflows of people from Europe. Yet Britain now has a larger share of foreign-born residents than America. It is good at assimilating immigrants. We consider what other countries can learn from its example.

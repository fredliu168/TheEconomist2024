Because of the Houthis, large numbers of oil tankers and cargo ships are avoiding the Suez canal and taking the long route around Africa. This has pushed up the cost of shipping containers between Asia and Europe by almost 300% since October. With pirates now attacking far out in the Indian Ocean, shipping companies will need to give Somalia a wide berth, too.

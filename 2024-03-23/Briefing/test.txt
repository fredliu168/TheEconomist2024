Saleh al-Arouri, another senior leader of the military wing, was assassinated in Beirut in January.

Nonetheless, a Rubicon has been crossed in that military assistance for Israel is now subject to open debate. Take, for instance, the instructions the president gave the State Department in February, to report on whether foreign governments are committing atrocities with American weapons. This is a box-ticking exercise for now, but future politicians may not use it that way. America has also imposed sanctions on violent Israeli settlers in the West Bank; these could be broadened to ensnare politicians like Mr Ben-Gvir. By the same token, federal law bars military aid to states that commit war crimes.

It could have been open to discussing post-war arrangements with America and Arab states. Some of these complaints are valid.

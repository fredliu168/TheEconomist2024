Two feuding sisters, Vera and Nadezhda, conspire to stop their 84-year-old Ukrainian-born father, who is recently widowed, from marrying Valentina, a 36-year-old gold-digger. Infatuated with her “golden hair” and Botticelli breasts, Viktor assures his daughters that Valentina also has strong views on Nietzsche, and, like him, abhors neoclassicism. They are unconvinced. Set in Peterborough, England, the novel is a riotous depiction of sibling rivalry and masculine pride. It sets the values of the first-generation, immigrant sisters against the materialistic culture of the Ukrainian Valentina. As hostilities unfold, the sisters learn plenty about their own Ukrainian heritage, not least because their father, an engineer, is writing an absolutely riveting history of the country’s tractors.","textHtml":"This best-selling debut was published in 2005.

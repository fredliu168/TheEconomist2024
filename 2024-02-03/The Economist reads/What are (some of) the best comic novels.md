IT’S A FRAUGHT business picking the funniest novels ever written, so we’re not going to. Instead, we’ve picked eight of the funniest, recognising that many, perhaps equally uproarious tales are not on the list. Nor are humorous books that aren’t novels—the works of S.J. Perelman and Stephen Potter, for example. Our comedic finalists range in age from nonagenarian (“Right Ho, Jeeves”) to teenaged (“Nature Girl”). Our geographic spread is less diverse. England is overrepresented, but so is Ukraine, which in 2019  to be its president. We’ve followed each of the write-ups below with snippets from the book, which, we hope, will send you chuckling to the bookseller. 
By Evelyn Waugh. 
The greatest comic novelist in English is . But which is his funniest book? Many people favour his first, “Decline and Fall”; others tout “Scoop”, a satire of mid-20th-century journalism. But for sustained comic brilliance our vote goes to “The Loved One”, published in 1948. During the previous year Waugh had visited California, at the invitation of Hollywood studios. Tiring of agents and producers, he became fascinated by the local mortuary and embalming business. “The Loved One”, set in the Whispering Glades Memorial Park, was the result. The story concerns a doomed love affair between a failed poet, Dennis Barlow, and a prim funerary cosmetician, Aimée Thanatogenos. It’s a hilarious dissection of the English in Hollywood, of American business ethics and of Hollywood itself. 
The first description of Aimée: 

 By John Kennedy Toole. 
The charms of Ignatius Reilly will be lost on some, but the protagonist of John Kennedy Toole’s novel is a comedic colossus. At odds with the modern world, this slothful behemoth of a man-boy farts, belches and bickers his way through a succession of lowly jobs in New Orleans to pay off his drunken mama’s debts, the erratic Mrs Reilly being his only consistent companion. The laughs are all in Ignatius’s haughty, misanthropic reflections on those unfortunate enough to come into his odorous orbit. Several publishers rejected Toole’s book—one reason why he  in 1969, aged only 31. It was due to the persistence of his mother Thelma, clearly a more capable woman than Mrs Reilly, that “A Confederacy of Dunces” was published 11 years later.

 By Helen Fielding. 
Starting life as a newspaper column, the Bridget Jones novels of the 1990s spawned an entire genre, “”. Its heroines, like Bridget, are often SINBADS (Single Income, No Boyfriend and Absolutely Desperate). “Bridget Jones’s Diary” started the series, but its sequel, “The Edge of Reason” (published in 1999), is even funnier, partly because Bridget at least starts off with “boyfriends 1 (hurrah!)”, Mark Darcy. This allows Ms Fielding to get into Bridget’s pantomime of a love life that much quicker. Our heroine tries to be a liberated, independent woman, if fortified by chardonnay and self-help books. But too often she slips into slavish dependence on unsuitable men with questionable taste in jumpers. The enemy? Smug Married Girls. It’s not exactly radical feminism, but the combination persuaded women (and men) to buy Bridget Jones books in the millions. Box-office hits, starring Renée Zellweger (pictured), followed.

 By Kingsley Amis. 
Kingsley Amis’s first novel is probably his best and certainly the funniest. Published in 1954, “Lucky Jim” established him as a leader of a new literary movement of “angry young men”. But the tone of “Lucky Jim” is not so much angry as irreverent and waspish. It chronicles the misadventures of an inept young history lecturer, Jim Dixon, in a provincial university in repressed, dreary post-war Britain. Academic life, amateur choirs and middle-class sexual mores are all skewered, often in hilarious set-pieces. Just as Bridget Jones inspired chick lit, “Lucky Jim” spawned the campus novel. 
Anxious to ingratiate himself with a professor, Dixon contemplates the title of his one academic article: 

 By Andrey Kurkov. 
The Ukrainian author’s novel about his post-Soviet homeland is more black than “lol”, but it sits squarely in the great tradition of eastern European satire; Andrey Kurkov is an heir to Nikolai Gogol, a Russian novelist of the 19th century. In terse prose, “Death and the Penguin” recounts a few weeks in the life of an aspiring writer, Viktor, whose only close companion is Misha, a king penguin he rescued from the bankrupt zoo in Kyiv. The depressive Misha waddles around their small flat, holding up a mirror to his saviour’s own bleak life. Viktor gains a commission from a newspaper to write obituaries, but discovers that his subjects are not necessarily dead yet; rather, they become dead after his obits are published, the victims of mysterious mafia-style executions. Viktor attends their funerals, and eventually comes to fear that he, too, is a target. He resolves to escape, with Misha’s help.

By Marina Lewycka. 
This best-selling debut was published in 2005. Two feuding sisters, Vera and Nadezhda, conspire to stop their 84-year-old Ukrainian-born father, who is recently widowed, from marrying Valentina, a 36-year-old gold-digger. Infatuated with her “golden hair” and Botticelli breasts, Viktor assures his daughters that Valentina also has strong views on Nietzsche, and, like him, abhors neoclassicism. They are unconvinced. Set in Peterborough, England, the novel is a riotous depiction of sibling rivalry and masculine pride. It sets the values of the first-generation, immigrant sisters against the materialistic culture of the Ukrainian Valentina. As hostilities unfold, the sisters learn plenty about their own Ukrainian heritage, not least because their father, an engineer, is writing an absolutely riveting history of the country’s tractors.

By Carl Hiaasen. 
From 1985 to 2021 the journalist Carl Hiaasen wrote a column for the chronicling the state’s abundance of corruption scandals and environmental destruction. This provided the raw material for a succession of madcap crime thrillers set in southern , a swamp of drifters, petty criminals, drug-smugglers, hitmen, bouncers—and politicians. The plots usually involve murder, lust and duplicity. Every Hiassen reader has a favourite. Many plump for “Striptease”, a satire on political sleaze that was made into a brilliant film starring Demi Moore as the stripper and Burt Reynolds as a wayward congressman. “Nature Girl” follows the adventures of single mom Honey Santana and her run-ins with a cast of very Hiaasenesque bad guys, including her boss Louis Piejack, who wants to make her his sex slave, and Boyd Shreave, an arrogant, unscrupulous telemarketer. She duly takes her revenge on both, big time.

By P.G. Wodehouse. 
They may well belong to different generations, but fans of P.G. Wodehouse are just as devoted to their idol as Swifties are to Taylor. His novels have sold more than 100m copies in more than 20 languages. Don’t dare suggest that the antics of the bumbling aristocrat Bertie Wooster and his butler, the arch, resourceful and endlessly patient Jeeves, may have dated a tad. Wodehouse continues to sell by the forest-load. TV series and films abound. The huge contemporary popularity of “Downton Abbey” testifies to the same lasting fascination with the mores of England’s upper classes of a century ago, even if Wodehouse spends a lot of his time sending them up (in a very gentle way). “Right Ho, Jeeves” is quintessential Wodehouse, full of japes, mishaps and ninnies like Gussie Fink-Nottle.

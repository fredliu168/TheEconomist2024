Ariel Henry agreed to step down as prime minister of once a new governing council is in place. Mr Henry has been out of the country for several weeks. In his absence Haiti became even more chaotic, with armed gangs, who now wield the real power, roaming at will.

and Hamas  that would have seen the release of some of the remaining hostages in  in exchange for a temporary ceasefire and the freeing of hundreds of Palestinian prisoners.

Mr Biden announced that America will build a pier off the coast of Gaza to enable the delivery of far greater quantities of . Separately a boat bringing 180 tonnes of food left Cyprus. It is the first ship authorised to deliver aid to Gaza since Hamas took control of the coastal strip in 2007.

Groups of fighters who are based in  but claim to be Russian said they had conducted raids across the border into  to draw Kremlin troops away from the front line. The fighters say they oppose Vladimir Putin—his government said it had repelled the assault. Russia also had to defend itself against a wave of Ukrainian drone attacks, some of which targeted oil refineries. 
Meanwhile the head of the Russian navy was reportedly sacked. Ukraine’s offensive against Russia’s  fleet has been highly effective. America thinks Ukraine has sunk 15 Russian ships over the past six months alone. 
Nevertheless, the head of the CIA and the director of US national intelligence said that Russia was gaining the upper hand in the , had increased its production of artillery shells and secured a supply of drones.

 took a turn towards the right at a general election. The centre-right Democratic Alliance won the most seats in parliament but fell short of a majority. The Socialists lost 43 seats, pushing them into second place. Chega, a right-wing populist party formed in 2019, came third with 18% of the vote, giving it 48 deputies.

Geert Wilders conceded that he would not become prime minister of the  as talks continued to form a government, four months after an election. Mr Wilders’s far-right Party for Freedom (pvv) won the most seats in the poll and still wants to be part of a new right-wing coalition. 
Voters in  overwhelmingly rejected two amendments to the constitution on family and the role of women. The first amendment sought to change marriage as the basis on which a family is founded to one that includes “durable relationships”. The second wanted to scrap a reference to a woman providing care within the home. Opponents to both amendments maintained that the replacement wording to the constitution was confusing, and would have excluded non-family members in a new definition of “caregivers”. 
Emmanuel Macron said he supported a bill that would enshrine rights in law for people who want to die and for those who help them. The  president said the bill, which the national assembly will debate in May, would refer to “aid in dying”, rather than assisted suicide.

A move backwards
 Election Commission took the first legal step towards banning Move Forward, a reformist party that came first in last year’s election but was blocked from taking power by the royalist establishment. The commission bases its reasoning on a ruling by the Constitutional Court, which held that Move Forward’s aim of changing the country’s  laws, which forbid any criticism of the monarchy, was illegal. 
The government in  implemented a  that eases the path to citizenship for members of some religious minorities from neighbouring countries but excludes Muslims. Hindus, Sikhs, Christians and others who fled to India from Afghanistan, Bangladesh or Pakistan before 2015 will be granted citizenship. Rohingya Muslims from Myanmar, for example, cannot apply. The government denies that the law is discriminatory.
Joe Biden and Donald Trump both won enough  in the latest batch of primaries to secure their parties’ nomination for president.

Textbooks and the media promote a seductive narrative of nationalism and Russian victimhood. Dissent at home has been strangled. The mutinous Yevgeny Prigozhin was blown from the sky and Mr Putin’s most charismatic political rival, Alexei Navalny, was murdered in the gulag in February.\u003cbr\u003e\u003cbr\u003eMany in the West hoped that Western sanctions and Mr Putin’s blunders in Ukraine might doom his regime. Yet as our study this week of life in \u003ca href=\"https://www.economist.com/interactive/europe/2024/03/13/vladivostok-is-a-window-into-wartime-russia\"\u003eVladivostok\u003c/a\u003e shows, it looks solid. Russia’s economy has been re-engineered. Oil exports bypass sanctions and are shipped to the global south. Western brands from \u003csmall\u003eBMW\u003c/small\u003e to \u003csmall\u003eH\u003c/small\u003e\u0026\u003csmall\u003eM\u003c/small\u003e have been replaced with Chinese and local substitutes. A prudent working assumption is that Mr Putin will be in power for years.","__typename":"ParagraphComponent"},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"We believe that outward aggression and inward repression are part of the same impulse. Mr Putin blames the West for challenges to his rule, and seeks to safeguard his regime by shutting out Western influence and trying to unite the Russian people in a struggle against a caricature of America and NATO.

St Basil’s Cathedral looms over the cobblestones.

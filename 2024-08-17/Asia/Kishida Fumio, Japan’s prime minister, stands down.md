WHEN HE CAMPAIGNED to become Japan’s prime minister, Kishida Fumio laid great stress on his listening skills. They were on display again on August 14th, as he announced that he would not seek re-election as president of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP), heeding the call from voters for fresh leadership. He will step down as prime minister after the party replaces him in late September.

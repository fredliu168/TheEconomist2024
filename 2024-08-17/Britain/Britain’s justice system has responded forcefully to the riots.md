Three Facebook posts were enough to get Jordan Parlour sent down. On August 2nd and 3rd the Britannia Hotel in Leeds, which was being used to house asylum seekers, was pelted with stones. The next day, Mr Parlour posted that “every man and their dog should be smashing fuck out Britannia Hotel”. He had no intention of attacking the hotel himself, but he later told police that he had been frustrated that taxpayers pay for migrants who “rape our kids and get priority”. After pleading guilty to “stirring up racial hatred”, Mr Parlour was sentenced at Leeds Crown Court on August 9th to 20 months in prison. He exhaled hard as he left the dock, rattling his lips in resignation.

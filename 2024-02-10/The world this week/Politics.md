Mr Trump had argued that he could only face prosecution in relation to “official acts” if Congress impeached and convicted him first, but the judges ruled that the former president is now merely “citizen Trump”. His trial in the case was due to start on March 4th, but the judge overseeing those proceedings has postponed the date indefinitely. 
They couldn’t run a bath
 in the Senate , which they themselves had spent months helping to craft, that tied military aid to Ukraine and Israel to stricter measures on border control. Mr Trump had made it clear that the party should not make a deal with Democrats on the border, as he wants to keep the issue alive for the election. The Democrats then separated the military-aid package into a different bill for a second vote. 
In another fiasco, the Republican-controlled House of Representatives rejected a vote to impeach Alejandro Mayorkas, America’s secretary of . It was a fruitless gesture that was in essence based on Mr Mayorkas’s remarks that the border with Mexico was secure. A few Republicans joined Democrats in opposing the measure. The Republican leadership vowed to hold another vote. 
America and its allies struck  in Iraq and Syria in retaliation for an attack that had killed three American soldiers at a base in Jordan. The Pentagon said that one of its strikes killed one of the commanders of the Kataib Hizbullah militia who had planned the attack.

Support for the African National Congress, which has been in power in  since the end of apartheid in 1994, has fallen below 40% just months ahead of a general election in which the party is expected to lose its parliamentary majority. 
Michelle O’Neill, the leader of Sinn Féin in , became the first-ever Irish-nationalist head of the province’s government. She was sworn in as first minister following the decision of the pro-British Democratic Unionists to return to the power-sharing executive. 
It was announced that  of Britain has cancer. He had recently been in hospital for a procedure on his prostate, but “a separate issue of concern” was found. The king has stepped back from making public appearances.

Nayib Bukele, who describes himself as the world’s coolest dictator, romped home to re-election in . Mr Bukele is popular because of his crackdown on crime, though he has retained power by circumventing a one-term limit on the presidency.

The  that have swept across Europe spread to Italy and Spain. The farmers have a wide range of complaints, including stringent green targets which they say are hurting their industry. The European Commission said that it would ditch a proposal to halve the use of pesticides, an apparent concession to the farmers. It also removed firm targets for agriculture from an ambitious plan to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions by 2040. 
Meanwhile, the European Parliament backed a measure where certain vegetables grown using  may be exempted from the EU’s strict regulations on genetically modified crops.

Amnesty International said Azeri authorities had intimidated government critics even more than usual ahead of the election.

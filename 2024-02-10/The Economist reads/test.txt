Liberals endorse Jinnah’s exhortation that it should be a secular state in which Hindus “are free to go to your temples”. Ayesha Jalal, a historian at Tufts University near Boston, Massachusetts, contends that Jinnah did not really want a separate Muslim homeland at all. He spent most of his political career campaigning for India’s independence from Britain. But he began to worry that the Hindu-dominated Indian National Congress, the main pro-independence party, would sweep away privileges enjoyed by elite Muslims like him. When he latched onto the idea of Pakistan, he saw it as a “bargaining chip” to strengthen the position of the Muslim minority within an independent India. But Congress did not yield, and so Pakistan was born. When Ms Jalal made this argument in 1985 Pakistani scholars and patriots condemned it as heresy.

In 1974 the zealots changed the constitution to redefine the members of the minority Ahmadi sect as non-Muslims.

They reveal a paranoid “strategic culture” shared by military men convinced that they are engaged in a civilisational battle with a neighbour that rejects the legitimacy of partition. Rather than merely seeking to dominate the subcontinent (which would be bad enough), India wants to reabsorb Pakistan, the generals believe. They consider Hindus to be meek and treacherous, and deem Muslims to be brave and committed to justice. From this flows much else, including the tactic of backing a myriad of anti-India jihadi groups while protected by a “nuclear umbrella”. The generals’ fear of Indian influence in Kabul, Afghanistan’s capital, explains their obsession with “strategic depth”, ie, ensuring that India has no foothold in Pakistan’s northern neighbour. The contest for influence there is reminiscent of the “great game”—Britain’s competition with Russia for clout in Afghanistan during the Raj—Ms Fair points out.","type":"text"}]},{"type":"tag","name":"p","attribs":{},"children":[{"type":"tag","name":"b","attribs":{},"children":[{"data":"The Pashtun Question: The Unresolved Key to the Future of Pakistan and Afghanistan.

The Taliban and its various offshoots on both sides of the border are an almost exclusively Pashtun movement. Militancy began after the British split the Pashtuns’ historic lands between India and Afghanistan, triggering numerous “frontier jihads”. After independence Pakistan backed Pashtun Islamists against nationalists who dreamed of creating a united Pashtunistan. Pakistan’s government in Islamabad also sponsored Islamist rebellions against the government in Kabul and, during Afghan resistance to the Soviet occupation in the 1980s, directed American resources to the most extreme Pashtun fundamentalists. This helped dislodge the Russians but radicalised and militarised many Pashtuns. More than a million have died since 1979 in wars involving Russia, American-led forces and other Afghans. Support for Islamists also backfired on Pakistan. Even though Pakistan helped the Afghan Taliban seize power from an American-backed government in 2021, the Taliban refuse to do Pakistan’s bidding.

The paintings of Salman Toor sell for more than $1m. The country also has many fine authors writing in English, including Mohammed Hanif. His debut novel, “A Case of Exploding Mangoes”, is a satire about the death of Zia ul Haq, the military dictator who seized power in 1977 and was largely responsible for Pakistan’s Islamisation. The book imagines the events leading up to the explosion of his plane on August 17th 1988 through a series of darkly comic episodes. Many of Mr Hanif’s characters want the pious and paranoid general dead. A bomb in a consignment of mangoes (Pakistan’s national fruit) is just one of the weapons that would-be assassins consider. The cruelty and absurdity of Zia’s rule is captured by the story of a blind woman who is gang-raped, then stoned for committing adultery. Mr Hanif trained to become an air-force pilot during the Zia era. One of Zia’s would-be assassins is also a trainee pilot.

The Sufi shrines that he regards as the “pulses of Old Pakistan” are blown up by jihadis who hate tolerant, syncretic strains of Islam.

But its attack on linguistic diversity helped lead to the secession of Bangladesh in 1971, four insurgencies in Balochistan, a province in the south-west, and violence in Karachi, Pakistan’s megacity. Mr Jaffrelot goes on to discuss the perpetual tussle between the army and politicians, arguing that the conflict is not simply caused by the power-hungry generals who have periodically seized control.

In 1974 the zealots changed the constitution to redefine the members of the minority Ahmadi sect as non-Muslims.

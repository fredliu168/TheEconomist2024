THE Themes used by the speaker were the usual Hindu-nationalist fare. The opposition Congress Party was planning to take away Indians’ wealth, including women’s  (Hindu bridal ornaments), and give it to “infiltrators” who “have more children”. The identity of the fecund intruders was left in no doubt: after all, the speaker alleged, Congress had argued in the past that Muslims should have the first claim to the country’s resources.
What was more unusual was the speaker’s identity: Narendra Modi, India’s prime minister, addressing an election rally in the northern state of Rajasthan last month. Mr Modi’s lieutenants in the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) have never shied away from scapegoating India’s 200m Muslims to rally their Hindu base, something he has never condemned. Yet the prime minister himself has in recent years been careful to avoid explicit Muslim-baiting.

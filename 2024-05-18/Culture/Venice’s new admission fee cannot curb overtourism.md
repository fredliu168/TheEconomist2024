VENICE HAS never been more full—or more empty. In 2022 the population of  dropped below 50,000, down from 175,000 in 1951. But as residents leave, tourists flow in. Some 20m-30m people visit every year, most for day trips, and crowd the historic city’s eight square kilometres. They rarely visit cultural sites: only around 360,000 go to the Gallerie dell’Accademia, one of the city’s major art museums. Officials complain of “hit-and-run” tourists who come for a few hours, dump their rubbish and then go home. 
So the city has introduced the tourism equivalent of a short-stay parking fare. Venice has started charging an “access fee” of €5 ($5.41) to day-trippers, becoming the first city in the world to do so. A host of other places, including Berlin, Lisbon and Vienna, have a “tourism tax” on overnight guests; this is the first for flying visits.

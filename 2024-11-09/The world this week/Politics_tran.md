Donald Trump won , handily beating Kamala Harris and becoming the first Republican to win the popular vote since 2004. He won all the crucial states that decided the election, including Michigan, Pennsylvania and Wisconsin. Iowa, which a recent poll suggested Ms Harris would unexpectedly win, ended up plumping for Mr Trump by a margin of 13 percentage points. Mr Trump said the results gave him a “great feeling of love” and “a powerful mandate”. He will be the first president to enter office who has been convicted of a felony.

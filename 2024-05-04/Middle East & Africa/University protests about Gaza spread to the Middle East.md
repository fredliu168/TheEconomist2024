Compared with the demonstrations about the war in Gaza that have rocked the campuses of American universities, those at Arab institutions have been more limited. That could be changing. “We see our comrades from Columbia to Chicago”, says Tom, a Lebanese student at the American University of Beirut (aub), who did not want to give his full name. He was one of over 100 students at a demonstration on the aub campus on April 30th “inspired”, he says, by their American counterparts. Students in Egypt, Jordan, Kuwait and Tunisia are also raising their voices.
The demonstrations in Beirut were orderly and restrained.The students strode along a designated route through aub with Palestinian flags held aloft. They were accompanied by university security guards. They chatted to journalists and then went back to their classes.

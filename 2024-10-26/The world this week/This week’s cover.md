Every day seems to bring more exciting news. First GLP-1 drugs tackled diabetes. Then, with just an injection a week, they took on obesity. Now they are being found to treat cardiovascular and kidney disease, and are being tested for Alzheimer’s and addiction. How can one class of drug do so much? GLP-1 drugs not only work in the gut, but also bind to receptors all over the body and in the brain. They appear to reduce inflammation and interact with mechanisms linked to cravings and feelings of reward. With time, experimentation and innovation, the benefits will become clearer, and the costs will come down. The possibilities are thrilling. Obesity and addiction may less often be seen as moral failings, but as illnesses that can be treated. The glp-1 revolution is just beginning. Its promise is tantalising.

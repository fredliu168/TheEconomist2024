The judgment was harsh but correct. Peel, the son of a rich cotton-mill owner, achieved much during a 31-year career in and out of government, which included two terms as prime minister. He founded modern policing and introduced legislation to reduce the working hours of women and children in factories. Though a Tory, Peel was instrumental in repealing the Corn Laws, which enriched landowners at the expense of everyone else by taxing imported grain. He championed Catholic emancipation. This should have made a good story, but Peel’s three volumes of reminiscences are and were plain fare, even for Victorian readers.","textHtml":"“Was there ever such a dull man?

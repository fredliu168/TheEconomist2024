It was an isolated incident, the government insists. On June 24th a Chinese man attacked a Japanese woman and her child at a bus stop outside a Japanese school in the city of Suzhou. A Chinese school-bus attendant, Hu Youping, tried to shield the pair, only to be stabbed herself. She died days later. The local administration has called Ms Hu a “righteous and courageous” role model.
Extreme Chinese nationalists, though, have a different view of the attack. In comments posted online they have spread rumours that Ms Hu had been a Japanese spy. Others urged more violence against Japanese people. Some social-media posts called for the establishment of a “modern-day Yihetuan”. The term refers to the Boxer Rebellion, an anti-foreign uprising in northern China between 1899 and 1901.

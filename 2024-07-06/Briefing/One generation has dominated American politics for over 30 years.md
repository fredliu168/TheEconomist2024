When Barack Obama became president in 2009, it appeared not just to be a changing of the guard, but the end of an era. Men born in the 1940s had occupied the White House for the previous 16 years; now it was the turn of a new generation. Mr Obama was born in the 1960s. His watchwords were “hope” and “change”. He had complained, in one of his many memoirs, about the “arrested development” of American politics, stuck in the “psychodrama of the Baby Boom generation”. It was time to move on, he wrote, from the stale feuds initiated on the college campuses of the 1960s.
Yet Mr Obama’s tenure turned out to be not a break with the past, but merely a brief respite from it. The two subsequent presidents, Donald Trump and Joe Biden, were both also born in the 1940s. And since they are the two main candidates in this year’s election (at least for now), one of them is likely to be president for another four years. Even if Mr Biden withdraws his candidacy, Mr Trump is currently the favourite anyway. That means their generation could end up locking up the presidency for most of the period from 1993 to 2029—getting on for 40 years.

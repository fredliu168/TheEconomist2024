Ever since Wang Yi, China’s foreign minister, visited Papua New Guinea (PNG) in April, Australia has been trying to fend off a security pact between the two countries. Mr Wang signed trade and technology agreements with James Marape, PNG’s prime minister, and reportedly pushed for a deal about policing. China has alarmed America and its allies by striking security agreements elsewhere in the Pacific, starting with the Solomon Islands in 2022. Mr Marape put PNG’s deal on hold after Australia, an American ally, objected.

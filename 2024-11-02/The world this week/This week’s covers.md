THIS WEEK we had just one cover: our endorsement for America’s election. We argue that a second Trump term comes with unacceptable risks. By making Donald Trump leader of the free world, Americans would be gambling with the economy, the rule of law and international peace. Next to Mr Trump, Kamala Harris stands for stability. True, she is an underwhelming machine politician. However she has abandoned the Democrats’ most left-wing ideas and is campaigning near the centre. If  had a vote, we would cast it for Ms Harris.

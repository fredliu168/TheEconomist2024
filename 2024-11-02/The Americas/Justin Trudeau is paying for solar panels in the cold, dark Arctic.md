The Sayisi Dene First Nation seems like a bad spot for a solar farm. It gets about half as many hours of sunshine as a place like Arizona. Any solar panels installed there will produce less than half as much electricity. And yet the Canadian government has committed C$300m ($215m) to pointing panels at grey, sub-Arctic skies, not just in Manitoba, but across the countryâ€™s dark north.

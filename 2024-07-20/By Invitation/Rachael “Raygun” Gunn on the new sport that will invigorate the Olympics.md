It joins new urban sports BMX, skateboarding and 3v3 basketball, which debuted at Tokyo 2020, and is part of a broader shift by the International Olympic Committee to include more youth-oriented events. Yet breaking is judged in a completely different way—a way that ensures audiences will see something entirely new at these Olympics.

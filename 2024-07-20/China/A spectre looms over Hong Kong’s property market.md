Properties on the Peak, a rich neighbourhood in Hong Kong, are among the world’s most desirable. But nobody lives in Dragon Lodge, an Italianate mansion built in the 1920s.

Rumour has it that nuns were beheaded there during the Japanese occupation in the second world war; they haunt the shadowy halls.

##### How we saw the world

In most of the world this week we look at where Donald Trump and J.D. Vance would take America. After surviving an assassination attempt, Mr Trump has picked his running-mate. In 2016 he picked a social conservative, to placate pro-life voters. So confident is he of victory today that this time he has tapped an articulate anti-globalist, anti-big business, anti-immigration, pro-worker, MAGA enthusiast who has little experience and does nothing to broaden Mr Trump’s electoral appeal. MAGA politics, which started as an erratic vehicle for one man’s ambition, now looks much more likely to become a programme for government that will endure beyond 2028.

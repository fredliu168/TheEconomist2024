At its peak in 2005 the London Stock Exchange (LSE) attracted nearly one in five companies that went public globally. In 2023 that share was around 1% (see chart 1). To arrest  the City’s regulators are loosening listing rules. And to show that it can still be a venue for blockbuster debuts, the LSE is chasing what would be its biggest-ever initial public offering (IPO)—for , a fast-fashion giant and one of the most valuable startups in the world.

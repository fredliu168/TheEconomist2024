# Why American sports teams switch cities so often 
##### And why fans outside America should fear being similarly jilted

EVEN BEFORE Michael Lewis wrote “Moneyball”, about the  (A’s) for doing more with less, the team was among baseball’s most celebrated. They are one of just two teams to win more than two consecutive World Series. Though they last triumphed in 1989, they have since made 13 playoff appearances. This year they sit last in their division, but they have a scrappy, spirited young squad.
Yet at a recent evening game against the Kansas City Royals, Oakland Coliseum was all but deserted. On the ramp connecting the stadium to the commuter train, rather than a gauntlet of vendors hawking team gear, there was just one. The crowd was too sparse to roar; individual claps and shouts echoed off tens of thousands of empty seats. The A’s average attendance this year—just over 6,400 in a park seating 63,000—is the lowest in America’s four major sports leagues. In this tomb of a stadium lurks a reminder for Americans and a warning for the rest of the world.

IN January 2020 Alec Ash, an English writer living in Beijing, arrived in the small mountain town of Dali in southwestern China. He and his fiancée had split up just two months before their wedding, and he wanted to escape. So he chose a mountain refuge to which a growing number of Chinese were fleeing, seeking a different kind of Chinese dream. The ancient town became known as “Dalifornia”.

The parties continue, but so does the Communist Party. Those who can get from Dalifornia to California still do.■

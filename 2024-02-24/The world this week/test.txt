The problem is simply put: Russia is becoming more dangerous, America is less reliable and Europe remains unprepared. But the scale of the solution is hard to comprehend.

Russia is much poorer and less populous than Europe. But the bear can still spread destruction and misery. We argue that the best place to stop Mr Putin is in Ukraine.

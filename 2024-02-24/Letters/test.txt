Within government \u003csmall\u003eHS2\u003c/small\u003e was primarily seen as a stand-alone transport project rather than as a means to tackle two of the country’s most significant issues: regional inequality and low productivity. \u003csmall\u003eHS2\u003c/small\u003e could have produced an agglomeration effect by making it easier, and faster, to travel and do business between our big towns and cities. But that kind of strategic clarity about the wider outcome of \u003csmall\u003eHS2\u003c/small\u003e was largely missing. Hence the piecemeal approach we have today. The main lesson, therefore, is the need to be clear about the core purpose that such projects are trying to achieve before they start, in order to build a national consensus that can stand the inevitable ups and downs of implementation.","__typename":"ParagraphComponent"},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"Tom KellyDirector of corporate affairs at HS2, 2013-19Coleraine, Londonderry","textHtml":"\u003csmall\u003eTom Kelly\u003cbr\u003e\u003c/small\u003eDirector of corporate affairs at \u003csmall\u003eHS2,\u003c/small\u003e 2013-19\u003ci\u003e\u003cbr\u003eColeraine, Londonderry\u003c/i\u003e","__typename":"ParagraphComponent"},{"type":"IMAGE","url":"https://www.economist.com/content-assets/images/20240203_TQD001.jpg","altText":"Depiction of internet infrastructure: routers and servers connected by cables, symbolising the essential components that form the backbone of the internet.","mode":"NORMAL","imageType":"ILLUSTRATION","caption":{"textHtml":"","__typename":"AnnotatedText"},"credit":"eBoy","source":null,"width":1280,"height":720,"__typename":"ImageComponent"},{"type":"CROSSHEAD","text":"Hot data","__typename":"CrossheadComponent"},{"type":"PARAGRAPH","text":"Technology Quarterly (February 3rd), on the physical underpinnings of the internet, tackled the need to decrease the carbon-dioxide emissions of data centres as they expand in number and power consumption.

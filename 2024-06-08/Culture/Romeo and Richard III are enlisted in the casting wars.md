TWO HOUSES, both alike in dignity, have invoked ancient grudges and sparked new mutinies on the vexed question of who should play whom in drama. Both are theatres in London that have made headlines with  leads. In different ways they suggest the commotion that casting decisions can cause, the benefits they can confer and the problems left unsolved.
There is a nice dramatic symmetry in casting Tom Holland, who plays Spider-Man in the  films, in another classic tale of volatile adolescence, “Romeo &amp; Juliet” (pictured). Both Spider-Man and Romeo hide big secrets; dragged into old enmities, both find their crush is the daughter of a foe.

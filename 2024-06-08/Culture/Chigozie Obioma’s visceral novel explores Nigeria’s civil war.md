NIGERIANS DO NOT speak much of the civil war of 1967-70. Most schools do not teach it in their curriculums. The median age of Nigerians is 17, so only a fraction of the 219m-strong population lived through the conflict. Those that did are often too scarred, or scared, to talk about it for the memories it might prompt.

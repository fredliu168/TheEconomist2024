Donald Trump’s date with Manhattan Criminal Court is not over yet. Next comes his punishment for  in the first degree. In days or weeks Mr Trump will sit for an interview with a probation officer, a ritual that informs every sentence. Routine questions will be put to him. How are his health and home life?

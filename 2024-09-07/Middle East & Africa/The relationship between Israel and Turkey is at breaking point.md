Turkish flags flew at half-mast on August 2nd, to the bemusement of many Turks. No Turkish grandee had died. The reason was the assassination, orchestrated by Israel, of Ismail Haniyeh, the political leader of Hamas, in next-door Iran. Turkey’s president, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, had reacted to the killing by declaring a day of national mourning. The same day, Turkey blocked access to Instagram, accusing the social-media platform of taking down posts in memory of Haniyeh.

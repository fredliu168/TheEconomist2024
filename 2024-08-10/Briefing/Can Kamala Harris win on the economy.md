Kamala Harris has all but erased Donald Trump’s polling lead in America’s seven swing states, which is testament to the excitement generated by her late entrance into the presidential race. This week, her campaign revved up in each of these battlegrounds. The blitz started on August 6th at a rally in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, the most crucial of the swing states, where she introduced Tim Walz, Minnesota’s governor, as her running-mate. From there the two were due to hold rallies in the other six states: Wisconsin, Michigan, North Carolina, Georgia, Arizona and Nevada.

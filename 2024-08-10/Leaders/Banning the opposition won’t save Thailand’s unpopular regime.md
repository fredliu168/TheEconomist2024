Thailand’s law against insulting the monarchy is arguably the world’s strictest. Each insult is punishable by three to 15 years in prison, and what counts as rude is broadly defined. People have been charged for such things as wearing a crop top similar to the king’s, throwing dog food at the police (implying they are the king’s attack dogs) and questioning whether an exclusive contract to manufacture covid-19 vaccines should have been awarded to a royal-owned firm.

TWO SURPRISING results came out in India on June 4th. One was the conclusion of a six-week-long general election in which the ruling Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) expected an easy victory on the back of its hugely popular leader, Narendra Modi, the prime minister. Exit polls forecast as many as 340 of 543 seats for the BJP. Instead, the party limped in with just 240 and formed a government only in coalition.

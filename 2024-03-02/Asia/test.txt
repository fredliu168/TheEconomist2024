America lifted its ban on Mr Prabowo in 2019, when he became defence minister. Since then he has reinforced military ties that go back to infantry training in the 1980s.

Brought up in London, Zurich and Kuala Lumpur, Mr Prabowo is multilingual, articulate and at home with foreign diplomats. Yet a feature of his style is to fire off blockbuster initiatives, only a few of them sensible. An example last year was a peace plan for Ukraine that Vladimir Putin could have written.

The hope is that democratic norms nurtured since Suharto’s fall in 1998 still count for much, despite recent erosions under Jokowi. And perhaps power, patronage and influence are too diffuse for a would-be strongman to dominate.

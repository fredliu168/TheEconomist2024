In most of the world this week we put Kamala Harris on our cover. Since Joe Biden abandoned his bid to be re-elected as America’s president on July 21st, Ms Harris, his vice-president, has become the Democratic Party’s presumptive nominee and is now all but certain to face off against Donald Trump in November. With the election just 100 days away, Mr Trump enjoys a commanding position in the polls. But as our leader explains, Ms Harris still has enough time to win the presidency. The question is whether she has the ability. After months of desultory campaigning, Americans have a race on their hands, and a good thing too. At a perilous time for their country and the world, they can look forward to a real contest.

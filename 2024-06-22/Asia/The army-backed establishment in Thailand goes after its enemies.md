IN ONE of a handful of politically charged cases passing through courts in Bangkok on June 18th, Thaksin Shinawatra, a former prime minister who was ousted in an army coup in 2006, was formally indicted for insulting the monarchy. In ordinary circumstances, that ought not to be surprising. The conservative establishment close to the monarchy and the army is notorious for reaching for Thailand’s harsh  law, with sentences of up to 15 years in prison, to hound perceived enemies. 
Even during long years in exile Mr Thaksin, at the head of his populist Pheu Thai movement, has been enemy number one. The charge has to do with a claim he made nearly a decade ago that the king’s powerful Privy Council was complicit in yet another coup, in 2014, when his sister was prime minister.

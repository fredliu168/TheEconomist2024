Try as he might, Joe Biden struggles to restrain Binyamin Netanyahu. So it is doubtful that a British literary collective can have much sway over Israel’s prime minister. But though the group may not halt the —or mitigate , its other avowed mission—it has performed one useful service. It has exposed the deep misconceptions that often feature in clashes over cultural funding: about power, morality and the exigencies of art.
The collective, Fossil Free Books (FFB), has set its sights on Baillie Gifford, a Scottish asset manager, which until recently sponsored ten literary festivals in Britain. The firm, charge the activists, invests in fossil-fuel producers and companies tied to Israeli security. (“Solidarity with Palestine and climate justice are inextricably linked,” FFB questionably maintains.) Their convoluted strategy involved pressuring the festivals and urging authors to withdraw from them, in the hope of pushing Baillie Gifford to  from these holdings. “Disruption” and “escalation” were promised.

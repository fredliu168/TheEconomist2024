AMERICAN VOTERS have a unique opportunity in 2024: to compare the records of two candidates who have already served as president. That choice belongs to entrepreneurs and business leaders, too. More and more prominent wealth-creators are warming to supporting Donald Trump, declaring it publicly and writing cheques. Reid Hoffman, a friend of mine with very different political views,  about this trend: 
“Unfortunately, many American business leaders have recently developed a kind of myopia, miscalculating what politics, and which political leaders, will truly support their long-term success. Perhaps this stems from their having lived their entire lives in a stable legal regime that they now take for granted. But a robust, reliable legal system is not a given. It is a necessity we can ill afford to live without. We trade it away at our peril.”

FOR DECADES  conjured an image of men in tailcoats demurely playing staid classical works in a concert hall. But the Kronos Quartet took to the stage in San Francisco on June 20th—for the first of four concerts celebrating their 50th anniversary—in rose-embroidered satin and brick-red linen. As for the music, it was resolutely contemporary, and included a virtuosic piece by Aleksandra Vrebalov, a Serbian-American, as well as one called “Kiss Yo’ Ass Goodbye”, a reworking of a song by , an American composer. 
In other words, it was a typical Kronos performance. The group has dedicated itself to expanding chamber music’s repertoire. They have sold over 4m albums—more than any other string quartet in history—and won three Grammy awards. On their golden anniversary, Kronos has a radiant record. And the group is poised for both change and continuity.

President Joe Biden is embarking on a gruelling, billion-dollar campaign to win the privilege of continuing to work until he is 86. To what end exactly? In his previous campaign, in 2019, Mr Biden said he wanted to save “the soul of the nation”—by which he meant depriving Donald Trump of the presidency. Mr Trump’s revenge candidacy this year has prompted Mr Biden to revive his old pitch. Our election model suggests the president has only about a 30% chance of securing re-election, although a debate between the candidates on June 27th could cause the polls to shift. A second victory for Mr Biden would properly vanquish his nemesis. But it would also leave the president with four more years in the White House.

Youth unemployment in Costa Rica, for example, is as high as 27%. Informal labour is much to blame. Dropping out of school to take temporary, informal work is standard.

Ms Domínguez Punaro has had to go part-time in order to care for her mother. That Latin America’s women have long been able to choose how many children to have has been a great boon.

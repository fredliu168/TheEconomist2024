For more than two decades after its creation in 1947, the country struggled to agree on a constitution and failed to hold general elections. The first ostensibly free and fair election, held under military rule in 1970, in response to huge pressure from civilians, led to civil war and the transformation of the country’s eastern wing into the independent state of Bangladesh.

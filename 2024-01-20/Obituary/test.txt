They were hiding from the rain in the back of the garbage truck when suddenly the compactor got going and crushed them both to death. Because they were only hourly workers, not full employees, the city would not pay proper compensation to their families.

They were given no overshoes, uniforms or rain-suits, and could not use the depot’s bathroom or the shower, being black men. By the end of the day he stank so bad that he couldn’t ride the bus, but walked home, where his wife Peggy would make him take off his clothes in the back yard, put on a housecoat and take a shower before he did anything.

So he also became a hustler, as his daddy was, in the good sense of doing any job he could find and could fit into his hours. Sometimes he picked cotton, sometimes chopped wood or pruned trees. (In the elegant white parts of the city, homeowners assumed that he could tidy their gardens as well as collect the trash.)

But again, when a few black youths on the sidelines broke windows and looted shops, the police pounced with their batons and Mace. A young man got killed by a shotgun, and he himself was clubbed so hard on his arm that he fled down to the strong, reassuring Mississippi river.

They could make a difference—he could make a difference—simply by not drinking Coca-Cola and not eating Wonder Bread, both made by companies with unfair hiring policies. The end, though, was the most extraordinary part, where Dr King spoke with a real voice of power: when he talked of letting justice roll down like waters, and said he had been to the mountaintop and seen the promised land.

He kept working there well into his 80s, partly needing the money, but confident that he was respected now. It was Dr King who had achieved this, and he felt tears ever afterwards when he thought of that. Someone had come from out of town to fight for them; thanks to him, the kicked-around “boys” had become men.

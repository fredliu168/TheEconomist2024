After almost a year of waiting for war, the exodus from south Lebanon came in a dramatic instant. Tens of thousands of Lebanese grabbed whatever and whoever they could and squeezed ten or more to a car to travel north, fleeing Israeli air strikes. The coastal highway was rammed. Aid agencies say over 200,000 Lebanese have been displaced since October 8th.

When she reached her old house, the only one undemolished in the village, Umm Hassan had to sit on the ground for a while. She dared not press the buzzer. When her brother did, a dark-complexioned woman opened it and welcomed them in. She spoke Arabic, but quickly said that she was not an Arab.

The Jewish woman said she could take it if she wanted to; but Umm Hassan, after picking up the jug, instead handed it back to her. Both women said, “Thank you.”

The Republican candidate for vice-president, J.D. Vance, warns that Democrats could win the election for what, in Donald Trump’s party, is a shocking reason: more people might vote for Kamala Harris. Mr Trump is still attacking mail-in ballots and early voting, insisting they help Democrats commit fraud. “We don’t need the votes,” he said late last month in Arizona. “We just want to make sure that they don’t cheat.”
